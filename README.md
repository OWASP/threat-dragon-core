# [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org) Threat Dragon #

Threat Dragon is a free, open-source, cross-platform threat modelling application including system diagramming and a rule
engine to auto-generate threats/mitigations. It is an [OWASP Incubator Project](https://owasp.org/www-project-threat-dragon/)
and follows the values and principles of the [threat modeling manifesto](https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/).
The roadmap for the project is a great UX, a powerful rule engine and integration with other development lifecycle tools.

The application comes in two variants:

1. [**A web application**](https://github.com/owasp/threat-dragon): For the web application, models files
are stored in GitHub (other storage will become available). We are currently maintaining
[a working protoype](https://threatdragon.org) in synch with the master code branch.

2. [**A desktop application**](https://github.com/owasp/threat-dragon-desktop): This is based on
[Electron](https://electron.atom.io/). There are installers available for both Windows and Mac OSX, as well as
rpm and debian packages for Linux. For this variant models are stored on the local filesystem.

[End user help](https://threatdragon.github.io) is available for both variants.

This repository contains the core files and modules that are shared between both the web and desktop variant.
